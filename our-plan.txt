🎩 Project Idea: “Grimoire: The Kiro-Native Haunted Skeleton”

Category: 🦴 Skeleton Crew (with bonus 🎭 Costume Contest vibes)

A Kiro-optimized app skeleton that lets you quickly spawn very different apps (like “Esports Cursed Arena” and “Haunted Clinic”) from the same base, with a spooky, polished dark UI.

This is not “just another template.”
It’s a Kiro-native skeleton: designed from day one to work amazingly with Kiro specs, hooks, and steering.

🧱 High-Level Concept

You build:

Grimoire Skeleton Core – a minimal but powerful full-stack template.

Config System (“Spells”) – define entities & features declaratively.

Two Real Apps Using the Same Skeleton:

🕹️ Cursed Arena – Esports tournament mini-platform

🩺 Haunted Clinic – Simple doctor appointment system

Judges see:

One clean skeleton.

Two very different apps built from it.

Repo fully wired to Kiro (specs, hooks, steering).

🧬 Core Features of “Grimoire Skeleton”

Think of this as a starter kit that any Kiro user can clone and use.

1. Core Tech (keep it simple)

You can pick something like:

Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind

Backend:

Either Next.js API routes

Or Appwrite / Supabase if you’re comfortable

Core folders:

/src
  /core        -> shared UI + logic (layout, auth wrappers, table, form)
  /modules     -> domain-specific modules (tournaments, doctors, etc.)
  /theme       -> dark & spooky themes
  /config      -> entity + routing config
/specs         -> specs for skeleton + example apps
/steering      -> Kiro behavior config
/hooks         -> Kiro hooks definitions

2. Built-in Capabilities

a) Auth & Roles (simple but real)

Email/password login or magic link

Roles: admin, staff, user

Role-based access guard on pages

b) Generic Entity Engine

A mini system that, given an entity definition like:

// config/entities.ts
export const entities = {
  tournament: { fields: ["name", "game", "startDate", "status"] },
  team:       { fields: ["name", "tag", "membersCount"] },
  doctor:     { fields: ["name", "speciality", "experienceYears"] },
  appointment:{ fields: ["patientName", "doctor", "date", "time", "status"] },
};


…can auto-generate:

List page (table with filters)

Create/edit form

Detail view

Not super complex, just generic enough.

c) Dark / Spooky Theming System

Base: clean dark UI (good contrast, good UX)

Then 2–3 “skins”:

nightmare_neon – neon green + purple, glitch animations.

bone_minimal – monochrome bone-white + black.

blood_moon – deep red accents & subtle glow.

Config example:

// config/theme.ts
export const theme = {
  skin: "nightmare_neon",
  showGhostCursor: true,
  useBoneSkeletonLoaders: true,
};


d) Common Layout

Left sidebar for navigation

Top bar with app title + theme toggle

Skeleton loaders shaped like ribs / bones when data loads

🧪 The Two Example Apps
1️⃣ App A – “Cursed Arena” (Esports Platform)

Purpose: show the skeleton handling a competitive, game-ish domain.

Entities:

tournament (name, game, date, prize)

team (name, tag, members)

match (tournament, teamA, teamB, score, status)

player (name, ID, team)

Pages / Flows:

Dashboard:

List of upcoming tournaments

Cards with spooky gradients & glitch hover effects

Tournaments:

List view with filters (status, game)

Detail view: description, table of matches

Teams:

List + team details

Optional:

Simple bracket-style listing (even text-based, not full bracket UI)

Theme:

Use nightmare_neon

Glitch animations on hover

Tournament cards look like “cursed arcade cabinets”

2️⃣ App B – “Haunted Clinic” (Doctor Booking)

Purpose: show the same skeleton in a serious, business-like domain.

Entities:

doctor (name, speciality, yearsExperience)

patient (name, phone/email)

appointment (doctor, patient, date, time, status)

Pages / Flows:

Dashboard:

Today’s appointments

Simple stats (total doctors, total patients)

Doctors:

List + profile view

Appointments:

List with filters (doctor, status, date)

Create appointment form

Theme:

Use bone_minimal or blood_moon

Clean dark UI with subtle heart-beat line animation (CSS)

States like “No appointments” show a fading ghost icon

🕹️ How the Skeleton is Used (Developer Flow)

This is what you’ll show in your submission/demo.

Clone Grimoire Skeleton
git clone ...

Choose app “spell” (config file)

For Cursed Arena: config/app.cursed-arena.ts

For Haunted Clinic: config/app.haunted-clinic.ts

Run with selected config

e.g., .env or CLI flag to pick which configuration to boot with.

Start dev server

npm run dev → skeleton auto-builds navigation & pages based on entities.

This proves the skeleton is:

Lean

Flexible

Reusable

🧟 How It Can Win (Strategy)
Potential Value

Any Kiro user can:

Start a new app using this skeleton as a template.

Quickly configure a SaaS dashboard, admin panel, or CRUD app.

It demonstrates best practices for Kiro-native projects:

Organized specs

Clear steering

Useful hooks

Clean folder structure

Creativity & Design

Spellbook/spooky vibe:

In the UI copy: “Summon new entity”, “Cast deployment ritual”, “Raise new module from the crypt”.

Subtle animations, not distracting but memorable.

Two apps show serious use-cases with a fun Kiroween layer.

🔄 Basic Flows (Summarized)
Flow 1 – End-user in Cursed Arena

Log in as organizer

Create “Halloween Cup” tournament

Create teams & players

Add matches, mark some as completed

View matches list on a neon-haunted dashboard

Flow 2 – End-user in Haunted Clinic

Log in as clinic staff

Add doctors

Add patients

Create appointments for specific doctors, times

View today’s schedule on dark “monitor-style” dashboard

Flow 3 – Developer using Skeleton

Add a new entity in config/entities.ts

Kiro (through hooks/specs) helps generate:

Pages

Forms

Basic tests & docs (this is where you flex Kiro)

Run app → new entity automatically appears in nav & UI.

What You Should Focus On

Because you have 18 days, aim for:

✅ A clean, understandable skeleton

✅ 2 working mini-apps (even if simple)

✅ Very polished dark UI (Kiroween vibes)

✅ Clear story: “This skeleton is designed for Kiro; built with specs/hooks/steering, and perfect for others to use inside Kiro.”
